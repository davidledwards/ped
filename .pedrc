# This section contains custom-defined color names that map to color values.
#
# Colors are values in the range of [0, 255] and follow the 8-bit ANSI standard
# at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit>.
#
# Standard ANSI colors in the range of [0, 15] are predefined, so there is no
# need to define them in this section unless the desire is to map a standard
# color name to a different color value.
#
# Predefine ANSI colors:
#   black = 0
#   red = 1
#   green = 2
#   yellow = 3
#   blue = 4
#   magenta = 5
#   cyan = 6
#   white = 7
#   gray = 8
#   bright-red = 9
#   bright-green = 10
#   bright-yellow = 11
#   bright-blue = 12
#   bright-magenta = 13
#   bright-cyan = 14
#   bright-white = 15
#
# Additional custom colors have been predefined and may be listed by running
# `ped --colors`.

# This section allows key sequences to be rebound to editing operations.
#
# An entry in this section follows the given format, where a sequence of keys
# can be chained together using a ":" delimiter:
#
#   "key[:key]..." = "operation"
#
# The list of available keys and operations can be discovered using the command
# line options --print-keys and --print-ops, respectively, and current key
# bindings can be discovered using --print-bindings.
#
# A handful of keys are prohibited from being rebound, which are noted below
# with an explanation as to why:
#
#   C-q : to ensure the user is able to quit ped
#   C-g : to ensure the user is able to cancel any operation
#   ESC : this key is a prefix of many other keys
#   tab : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   ret : has a ubiquitous meaning
#   del : has a ubiquitous meaning
#
[bindings]
# A binding to a single key.
"C-^" = "set-mark"

# A binding to a sequence of keys.
"M-x:y:z" = "move-top"

# Note that "M-<key>" may be used as shorthand for "ESC:<key>". Both of the
# following bindings are identical.
"M-x:e" = "move-end"
"ESC:x:e" = "move-end"
